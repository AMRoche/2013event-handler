title: "London JS: Data Visualisation"
text: |
  With all the new HTML5 APIs and node.js making waves in the backend, it's never been a better time to be a JavaScript developer. London JS will (try and) meet on a Monday of each month to hear a couple of talks on the exciting new topics that are influencing our field, before retiring to the local pub.

  **Tickets will be released on Friday the 4th of October at 2PM.**
